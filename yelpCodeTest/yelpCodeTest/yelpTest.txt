A must if you want some deep dish pizza! 

I've eaten at Dino's and Giordano's in Chicago because it's suppose to be "famous" Chicago pizza where deep dish comes from. Hands down, Little Star is better!

It's a bit pricey, but well worth it. The ambiance is great...kind of intimate since they dim the lights. Be aware that they pass the Health Tax to your bill, so it might be an extra buck or two.

I always recommend this place when I have out of town friends over.
